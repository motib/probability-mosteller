\begin{prob}{The prisoner's dilemma\annotate{D}}

Three prisoners $A,B,C$ are eligible for parole. The parole board will release two of them with equal probability for $\{A,B\}, \{A,C\}, \{B,C\}$, so the probability that $A$ will be released is $2/3$. Prisoner $A$ is told the name of one of the other prisoners who will be released. If $A$ is told that prisoner $B$ will be released, what is the probability that $A$ too will be released?

The article \cite{carlton} is devoted to the prisoner's dilemma and the related Monty Hall problem.
\end{prob}

\solution{1}

Let $P(A), P(B), P(C)$ be the probabilities that $A,B,C$ are released. $A$ is interested in the conditional probability $P(A|B)$ of his being released if $B$ will be released:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{1/3}{2/3}=\frac{1}{2}\,.
\]
But that is \emph{not} the correct conditional probability! Let $R_{AB}$ be the event that $A$ is \emph{told} that $B$ will be released. The probability that must be computed is $P(A|R_{AB})$:
\[
P(A|R_{AB}) = \frac{P(A\cap R_{AB})}{P(R_{AB})}\,.
\]
We assume that the report of $B$'s release is true so:
\[
P(A\cap R_{AB})=P(\{A,B\})=\disfrac{1}{3}\,.
\]
Now:
\[
P(R_{AB})=P(\{A,B\})+P(\{B,C\})=\disfrac{1}{3}+\disfrac{1}{2}\cdot \disfrac{1}{3}=\disfrac{1}{2}\,.
\]
If $\{B,C\}$ are to be released $A$ could be \emph{told} that either $B$ or $C$ is to be released, hence the factor of $1/2$. Therefore:
\[
P(A|R_{AB}) = \frac{P(A\cap R_{AB})}{P(R_{AB})} = \disfrac{1/3}{1/2}=\disfrac{2}{3}\,,
\]
so if $A$ is told that $B$ will be released the probability that $A$ will be released does not change.

\solution{2}

There are four possible events:
\begin{description}
\item[$e_1$:] $A$ is told that $B$ will be released and $\{A,B\}$ are released. 
\item[$e_2$:] $A$ is told that $C$ will be released and $\{A,C\}$ are released. 
\item[$e_3$:] $A$ is told that $B$ will be released and $\{B,C\}$ are released. 
\item[$e_4$:] $A$ is told that $C$ will be released and $\{B,C\}$ are released. 
\end{description}
Each pair of prisoners has equal probability of being released so:
\[
P(e_1)=P(e_2)=P(e_3\cup e_4)=\frac{1}{3}\,.
\]
We assume that if $\{B,C\}$ are to be released, $A$ is told either that $B$ or $C$ will be released with equal probability, so $P(e_3)=P(e_4)=1/6$. Therefore the probability that $A$ will be released given the event $R_{AB}=e_1\cup e_3$ that $A$ is told that $B$ will be released is:
\[
P(A|R_{AB}) = \frac{P(e_1\cap(e_1\cup e_3))}{P(e_1\cup e_3)}=\frac{P(e_1)}{P(e_1\cup e_3)}=\frac{1/3}{(1/3)+(1/6)}=\frac{2}{3}\,.
\]

\solution{3}

A riddle attributed to Abraham Lincoln asks: ``If you call the tail of a dog a leg, how many legs does the dog have?'' The answer is that calling a tail a leg doesn't make it a leg, so the dog still has four legs. Clearly, whether $A$ knows $B$'s future doesn't change his chances of being released.

\textbf{Simulation}

There is no simulation: the problem asks if the probability changes as the result of some knowledge but we have shown that it does not change.

\begin{prob}{Collecting coupons}
Given a unbounded sequence of boxes each of which contains coupons numbered $1$ to $5$, you randomly draw one coupon sequentially from each box.

\que{1} What is the expectation of the number of coupons drawn until you have all five of the numbers?

\que{2} Develop a formula for the expectation for $n$ numbers.

\textbf{Hint:} Use the solution to Problem~4 on page~\pageref{p.four} and the approximation for $H_n$, the sum of harmonic numbers (page~\pageref{p.harmonic}).
\end{prob}

\solution{}

\ans{1} What is the expectation of the number of draws until you get a  number that is \emph{different from} all the previous ones? By  Problem~4 this is $1/p$ where $p$ is the probability of drawing a different number. For the first draw the probability is $1=5/5$ so the expectation is also $1/(5/5)=5/5$, for the second draw the probability is $4/5$ so expectation is $5/4$, and so on. Therefore:
\[
E(\textsf{all five numbers}) = \frac{5}{5}+\frac{5}{4} + \frac{5}{3} + \frac{5}{2} + \frac{5}{1} = \frac{}{} =\frac{1370}{120}\approx 11.4167\,.
\]
\ans{2} Use the same method and the approximation for $H_n$:
\[
E(\textsf{all}\;n \;\textsf{numbers}) = n\left(\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n-1} + \cdots \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{1}\right) =nH_n\approx n\left(\ln n + \frac{1}{2n} + 0.5772\right)\,. 
\]
For $n=5$ this gives:
\[
E(\textsf{all five numbers}) =5H_5\approx 5(\ln 5 + \frac{1}{10} + 0.5772) \approx 11.4332\,.
\]

\textbf{Simulation}

Expectation of draws = 11.4332

Average draws        = 29.3001

\begin{prob}{The theater row}
Arrange $8$ even numbers and $7$ odd numbers randomly in a row, for example:
\[
10\quad 12\quad 3\quad 2\quad 9\quad 6 \quad 1\quad 13\quad 7\quad 10\quad 3\quad 8\quad 8\quad 5\quad 20\,,
\]
which we can write as follows since the specific numbers are not important:
\[
E\quad E\quad O\quad E\quad O\quad E \quad O\quad O\quad O\quad E\quad O\quad E\quad E\quad O\quad E\,.
\]
What is the expectation of the number of even-odd or odd-even adjacent pairs?

In the example there are $10$ $EO$ or $OE$ adjacent pairs.

\textbf{Hint:} What is the probability that a pair of adjacent number are different?
\end{prob}

\solution{}

The following table shows the $10$ possible arrangements of $3$ even and $2$ odd numbers. The total number of different adjacent pairs is $24$ and the average is $24/10=2.4$.
\[
\begin{array}{l|r@{\hspace{2em}}|@{\hspace{2pt}}|@{\hspace{2em}}l|r}
\textsf{Arrangement}&\textsf{Pairs}&\textsf{Arrangement}&\textsf{Pairs}\\\hline
EEEOO & 1&
EEOEO & 3\\
EEOOE & 2&
EOEOE & 4\\
EOEEO & 3&
EOOEE & 2\\
OEEOE & 3&
OEEEO & 2\\
OEOEE & 3&
OOEEE & 1\\
\end{array}
\]
Returning to the example with $15$ numbers, let $P_d$ be the probability that a given pair in an arrangement is $EO$ or $OE$:
\[
P_d =P(EO) + P(OE) = \frac{8}{15}\cdot \frac{7}{14} + \frac{7}{15}\cdot \frac{8}{14} = 2\cdot \frac{8}{15}\cdot \frac{7}{14} = \frac{8}{15}\,.
\]
Let $E_d$ be the expectation of the number of pairs in an arrangement that are $EO$ or $OE$. Since an $EO$ or $OE$ pair contributes $1$ to the count of different pairs and an $EE$ or an $OO$ pair contributes $0$:
\[
E_d =
\sum_{\textsf{\footnotesize all pairs}} (1\cdot P_d + 0\cdot (1-P_d))= 14\cdot \frac{8}{15} \approx 7.4667\,.
\]

Check for $10$ numbers:
\begin{eqn}
P_d &=& P(EO) + P(OE) = \frac{3}{5}\cdot \frac{2}{4} + \frac{2}{5}\cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{5}\\
E_d &=& 4\cdot \frac{3}{5}=\frac{12}{5}=2.4\,.

\solution{}

\ans{1}
If $a_1$ is assigned to one of the games $\{g_1,g_2,g_3,g_4\}$ none of the other players assigned to these games will reach the final, so $a_2$ must be assigned to one of $\{g_5,g_6,g_7,g_8\}$. The temptation is to conclude that the probability of $a_2$ being the runner-up is $1/2$ since $a_2$ must be assigned to one of the four games $\{g_1,g_2,g_3,g_4\}$. However, whatever game $a_1$ is  assigned to, $a_2$ will be the runner up only if he is assigned to one of the four \emph{remaining} seven games so the probability is $4/7$.

\ans{2} Similarly, of the $2^n-1$ games that $a_1$ is not assigned to, $a_2$ must be assigned to one of the $2^{n-1}$ games not in the same half as $a_1$. Therefore:
\[
P(a_1,a_2\;\textsf{playing each other in the final})=\frac{2^{n-1}}{2^n-1}\,.

\begin{prob}{Twin knights\annotate{D}}

Eight players $\{a_1,\ldots,a_8\}$ are randomly assigned to play games $\{g_1,\ldots,g_8\}$ in a tournament (Figure~\ref{f.tournament}). Let $P(i,j)$ be the probability that $a_i$ wins against $a_j$. For all $i,j$, $P(i,j)=P(j,i)=1/2$.

\que{1} What is the probability that $a_1,a_2$ play each other?

\que{2} If there are $2^n$ players what is the probability that $a_1,a_2$ play each other?
\end{prob}

\solution{}

\ans{1} Without loss of generality assign $a_1$ to $g_1$. Consider the different possibilities that $a_1,a_2$ play each other. With probability $1/7$, $a_2$ is assigned to $g_2$. With probability $2/7$, $a_2$ is assigned to $g_3$ or $g_4$, but $a_2$ doesn't play $a_1$ unless \emph{both} of them win their first game, so we need to multiply the probability of this assignment by $1/4$. With probability $4/7$, $a_2$ is assigned to $g_5,g_6,g_7,g_8$, but $a_2$ doesn't play $a_1$ unless \emph{both} of them win their first two  games, so we need to multiply the probability of this assignment by $1/16$. Therefore:
\[
P(a_1, a_2\;\textsf{play each other})=\frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{4}\cdot \frac{2}{7} + \frac{1}{16}\cdot \frac{4}{7} =\frac{1}{4}\,.
\]

\ans{2}
Let $P_n$ be the probability that in a tournament with $2^n$ players $a_1$ and $a_2$ play each other. We have shown that $P_3=1/4$. What about $P_4$? Using the same approach:
\begin{eqn}
P_4 &=& \frac{1}{15} + \frac{1}{4}\cdot \frac{2}{15}  + \frac{1}{16}\cdot \frac{4}{15}  + \frac{1}{64}\cdot \frac{8}{15} \\
&=&\frac{1}{15}\left(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}\right)=\frac{1}{8}\,.
\end{eqn}%
It is reasonable to conjecture that $P_n=1/2^{n-1}$.

\textbf{Proof 1:} Using the same approach and the formula for the sum of a geometric series:
\begin{eqn}
P_n&=&\frac{1}{2^n-1}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}2^i\cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2i}\\
&=&\frac{1}{2^n-1}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}2^{-i}\\
&=&\frac{1}{2^n-1}
  \left(
    \frac{1-(1/2)^{(n-1)+1}}
         {1-(1/2)}
  \right)=\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\,.
\end{eqn}%

\textbf{Proof 2:} By induction. The base case is $P_3=1/4=1/2^{3-1}$.

There are two inductive steps:

\textit{Case 1:} $a_1$ and $a_2$ are assigned to different halves of the tournament:
\[
P(a_1,a_2\;\textsf{assigned to different halves})=\frac{2^{n-1}}{2^n-1}\,.
\]
They can only meet in the final game and therefore both must win all of their $n-1$ games:
\begin{equation}\label{eq.17a}
P(a_1,a_2\;\textsf{meet if assigned to different halves})=\frac{2^{n-1}}{2^n-1} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n-1} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n-1}=\frac{2^{-(n-1)}}{2^n-1}\,.
\end{equation}
\textit{Case 2:} $a_1$ and $a_2$ are assigned to the same half of the tournament:
\[
P(a_1,a_2\;\textsf{assigned to the same half})=\frac{2^{n-1}-1}{2^n-1}\,.
\]
Since both players are in the same half the problem has been reduced to determining $P_{n-1}$. By the inductive hypothesis:
\begin{equation}\label{eq.17b}
P(a_1,a_2\;\textsf{meet if assigned to the same half})=\frac{2^{n-1}-1}{2^n-1}\cdot \frac{1}{2^{n-2}}=\frac{2^{1}-2^{-(n-2)}}{2^n-1}\,.
\end{equation}
Combining Equations~\ref{eq.17a}, \ref{eq.17b} gives:
\[
\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{2.2}
\begin{array}{rcl}
P_n&=&\disfrac{2^{-(n-1)}}{2^n-1}+\disfrac{2^{1}-2^{-(n-2)}}{2^n-1}\\

\que{2} Toss a fair coin $40$ times. What is the probability of obtaining $20$ heads?
\end{prob}

\solution{}

\ans{1} Since the coin is fair the probability of obtaining $10$ heads in $20$ tosses is given by the binomial distribution:
\[
P(10\;\textsf{heads in}\; 20\; \textsf{tosses})={20 \choose 10} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{10}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{10} \approx 0.1762\,.

\[
P(20\;\textsf{heads in}\; 40\; \textsf{tosses})={40 \choose 20} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{20}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{20}\approx 0.1254\,.
\]
By the law of large numbers the numbers of heads and tails will be ``roughly'' equal \cite[Section~8.4]{ross}, but they are unlikely to be exactly the same, and this event becomes less likely as the number of tosses increases.

If \duel{A}{H}{B} (probability $0.3$) then $A,C$ alternately shoot at each other until one is hit. The possibilities are:
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
(1)&C\stackrel{H}{\longrightarrow}A\\
(2)&C\stackrel{M}{\longrightarrow}A \stackrel{H}{\longrightarrow}C\\
(3)&C\stackrel{M}{\longrightarrow}A \stackrel{M}{\longrightarrow}C\stackrel{H}{\longrightarrow}A\\
(4)&C\stackrel{M}{\longrightarrow}A \stackrel{M}{\longrightarrow}C\stackrel{M}{\longrightarrow}A\stackrel{H}{\longrightarrow}C\\
(5)&C\stackrel{M}{\longrightarrow}A \stackrel{M}{\longrightarrow}C\stackrel{M}{\longrightarrow}A\stackrel{M}{\longrightarrow}C\stackrel{H}{\longrightarrow}A\\
(6)&C\stackrel{M}{\longrightarrow}A \stackrel{M}{\longrightarrow}C\stackrel{M}{\longrightarrow}A\stackrel{M}{\longrightarrow}C\stackrel{M}{\longrightarrow}A\stackrel{H}{\longrightarrow}C\\
&\cdots
\end{array}
\]
The probability of $A$ wins by eventually hitting $C$ is the sum of the probabilities of the even-numbered scenarios in the list:
\begin{eqn}
P(A\;\textsf{wins} \;| A\; \textsf{hits}\;B )&=&(0.5 \cdot 0.3) + \\
&&(0.5 \cdot 0.7) (0.5 \cdot 0.3) + \\
&&(0.5 \cdot 0.7) (0.5 \cdot 0.7) (0.5 \cdot 0.3)+ \cdots\\
&=&0.15 \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} 0.35^i= \frac{0.15}{1-0.35}=\frac{3}{13}\approx 0.2308\,.
\end{eqn}%
Similarly, the probability of $C$ winning is $\disfrac{0.5}{1-0.35}=\disfrac{10}{13}\approx 0.7692$.

The expectation is:
\vspace*{-1ex}
\[
\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{array}{l}
E(A \;\textsf{wins}) =E(A \;\textsf{wins}\;|\;A\;\textsf{misses}\;B) + E(A \;\textsf{wins}\;|\;A\;\textsf{hits}\;B)=\\
\qquad\qquad
\overbrace{1\cdot (0.7\cdot 1\cdot 0.3)}%
^{A\stackrel{M}{\longrightarrow}B, B\stackrel{H}{\longrightarrow}C, A\stackrel{H}{\longrightarrow}B}\;+
%
\overbrace{0\cdot (0.7\cdot 1\cdot 0.7\cdot 1)}%
^{A\stackrel{M}{\longrightarrow}B,
B\stackrel{H}{\longrightarrow}C,
A\stackrel{M}{\longrightarrow}B,
B\stackrel{H}{\longrightarrow}A}\; +
%
\overbrace{1\cdot 0.2308}%
^{A\stackrel{H}{\longrightarrow}B,
C\stackrel{H}{\longleftrightarrow*}A,
A\stackrel{H}{\longrightarrow}C}\; +\\
%
\qquad\;\,\overbrace{0\cdot 0.7692}%
^{A\stackrel{H}{\longrightarrow}B,
C\stackrel{H}{\longleftrightarrow*}A,
C\stackrel{H}{\longrightarrow}A}
\approx \; 0.2792\,,
\end{array}
\]
which is higher than the expectation of winning by shooting at $C$ first.

\ans{2} If $A$ shoots into the air not hitting anyone (probability $1$) then $B\stackrel{H}{\longrightarrow}C$ with probability $1$ and $A$ can try to hit $B$ with probability $0.3$. The expectation is:
\[
E(A \;\textsf{wins}|A\;\textsf{shoots in the air}) = 1\cdot (1\cdot 1 \cdot 0.3) + 0\cdot(1\cdot 1\cdot 0.7)=0.3\,,
\]
which is better than the expectation for the other two strategies!

\textbf{Simulation}
\begin{verbatim}
For A fires first at C:
Expectation of wins = 0.2100
Average wins        = 0.2138
For A fires first at B:
Expectation of wins = 0.2792
Average wins        = 0.2754
For A fires in the air:
Expectation of wins = 0.3000
Average wins        = 0.3000
\end{verbatim}
