This document is a "reworking" of Frederick Mosteller's *Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability with Solutions*, Dover, 1965. The problems and their solutions (50 of the 56 in the book) are presented in a manner accessible to readers with an elementary knowledge of probability, and many of the problems are accessible to secondary-school students and teachers. The problems and solutions have been rewritten to include detailed calculations and additional explanations and diagrams.

The LaTeX source code can be found in directory `en`.

Python programs for most of the problems can be found in the directory `programs`.

Excel programs generously provided by Michael Woltermann (<mwoltermann@washjeff.edu>) can be found in directory `excel`.

The Hebrew translation (directory `he`) is very preliminary.
