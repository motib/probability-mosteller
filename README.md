This document is a "reworking" of Frederick Mosteller's *Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability with Solutions*, Dover, 1965. The problems and their solutions (50 of the 56 in the book) are presented as far as possible in a manner accessible to readers with an elementary knowledge of probability, and many of the problems are accessible to secondary-school students and teachers. The problems and solutions have been rewritten to include detailed calculations and additional explanations and diagrams.

Python programs for most of the problems can be found in the directory `program`.

The document is currently a draft and you are encouraged to download it and to send me comments, corrections and suggestions. I would appreciate it if you do not fork the repository until I release a (more-or-less!) final version.

The same request applies to the Hebrew translation.
